> This project is an app with the target of helping my track my finance and have better understanding of what is going on with my personal finance.

Now i want to describe how i expect the app to be built.

For now I'm building macos only so I'm going to think about it desktop first but at the same time i will consider stuff in mobile and will optimize for it later.

One thing that is clear to me right now is that I want to think in a Ladger way, so credit debit.

- credit: The action of receiving money is a credit action.
- debit: The action of giving moeny is a debit action. 

## What the UI should show?

- Total debt
- Total Expenses
- Total Income

Also the UI should show a the list of transactions so we will have two main section:

- Recap
- Transaction History

### Total debt

for total debt the information i want to see is the break down of the debt, so how much credit to someone and how many debit I've received from that person and why.
Each debt should have this information:

- total: the amount of debt
- expires: when the debt is due for
- minimum-payment: what is the minimun payment that i can make on it
- frequency: when is due (monthly, weekly, daily, ecc..)

### Total Expenses

> To define

### Total Income

> To Define
